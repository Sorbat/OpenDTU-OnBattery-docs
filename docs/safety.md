## Liability

The contributors to OpenDTU-OnBattery are **not** liable for any damage or injuries
caused by the use of the software or recommended hardware. Users act on their
own responsibility.

## Electricity

!!!danger "Voltage and Current"
    * High voltages can be harmful to the human body. Use insulated tools when
      working with electrical conductors.
    * High currents can lead to a fire. Use appropriately sized wiring, clean
      contacts, and securely clamped connections.
    * Use resettable fuses to protect wiring against excessive currents or to
      disengage power from wiring that causes issues or needs to undergo
      maintenance.

OpenDTU-OnBattery is a DIY project, so you are likely to assemble hardware by
yourself (to a varying degree). Make sure you understand the possible
consequences of errors and accidents when handling solar panels and batteries.
Take precautions to prevent injury or damages, like using insulated tools to
prevent shocks or short circuits.

For starters, you may want to consult the extensive guide "Wiring Unlimited" by
Victron in [English](WiringEn) or [German](WiringDe), which covers the topic of
wiring in systems with batteries, charge controllers, and inverters.
